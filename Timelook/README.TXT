My home page will consist of information which invites the user. It also includes a quote
that time is precious. 
If the user clicks the about page, they will be taken to another page that will ask a question
that can be related to many of us. This page clarifies that this web site will help the user
manage their time properly and has a direct link to the calculate page, which I will talk about later.
If the user clicks the tips page, a list of tips are shown which the user can read and can hopefully 
apply the next time they have a task/project due. 
When the user clicks the timelook calcuator or click on the direct link from the about page, they 
are able to view 10 empty boxes. The first column of five boxes is where the user needs to enter five task.
The user cannot leave any of the five boxes unanswered or an error message will appear. In the next column
of five boxes, the user must enter the days until the task is due to the corresponding textbox. These also
must not be left empty, and they must consist of values from 1-365 (days). Whenever the user has finished inputting
the data, they can either select the day button, month button, or the year button.They correspond to how they should
efficiently be working on the respective task for the chosen button. An algorithm will compute the data and will update
the graph below the buttons. This graph should allow the user to view how much of their time they should spend on the task.
Lastly, if the user clicks on the contact page, they view text that indicates if they have any questions or concerns, they
should contact the respective email address.
